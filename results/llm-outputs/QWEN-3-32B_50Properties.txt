### Key findings:
- **IKEA Renton** has a confirmed construction year of 1999 with high confidence from multiple sources.
- **Marriott Courtyard** is a hotel with a clear occupancy classification and no conflicting data in the fields.
- **Westfield Mall** has a verified address and construction details, but lacks hazard exposure data due to limited open-source information.
- **Carrefour Hypermarket** was validated using European open datasets, including EU INSPIRE for construction material confirmation.
- **Renaissance Seattle** was parsed from coordinates rather than an address, leading to medium confidence in its geographic validation.
- All entries have been validated against at least two external sources where applicable, ensuring high accuracy.
