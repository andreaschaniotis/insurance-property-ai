To process **Batch A** using the **Insurance Property Location Risk Classification System — v7.7**, I will follow the outlined rules and procedures step by step. This includes cleaning up input data, geocoding addresses, validating sources, and populating fields based on available external data.

---

### **Step 1: Input Parsing**
The provided batch contains properties in **Pipe Format** (`|`). Each entry is parsed into the following fields:
- **Property Name**
- **Address** (or Lat/Lon if provided)
- **Occupancy (ISIC)** (if provided)

For entries with missing Occupancy, we will attempt to infer it from external sources.

---

### **Step 2: Data Enrichment**
Each property will be processed according to the **PROCESSING PRIORITIES**:
1. **ADDRESS** (geocoded using ≥ 2 sources)
2. **OCCUPANCY (ISIC)** (validated against Tier 1/2 sources)
3. **LAT/LON** (cross-checked for precision)
4. **STORIES & YEAR BUILT**
5. **CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL**
6. **HAZARD SCORE**

---

### **Step 3: Output Table**
Below is the populated table for **Batch A**:

To process **Batch E**, I will follow the **Insurance Property Location Risk Classification System — v7.7** guidelines step by step. This includes parsing the input, enriching data using approved sources, and populating the output table while adhering to the **Zero-Fabrication Rule** and other specified rules.

---

### **Step 1: Input Parsing**
The provided batch contains properties in **Pipe Format** (`|`). Each entry is parsed into the following fields:
- **Property Name**
- **Address** (or Lat/Lon if provided)
- **Occupancy (ISIC)** (if provided)

For entries with missing Occupancy, we will attempt to infer them from external sources.

---

### **Step 2: Data Enrichment**
Each property will be processed according to the **PROCESSING PRIORITIES**:
1. **ADDRESS** (geocoded using ≥ 2 sources)
2. **OCCUPANCY (ISIC)** (validated against Tier 1/2 sources)
3. **LAT/LON** (cross-checked for precision)
4. **STORIES & YEAR BUILT**
5. **CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL**
6. **HAZARD SCORE**
