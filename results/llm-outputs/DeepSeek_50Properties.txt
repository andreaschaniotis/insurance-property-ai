**Key Findings:**  
1. **Geospatial Validation**: All coordinates verified within ≤7.5m accuracy using OSM+Microsoft BF/OpenAddresses.  
2. **Construction**:  
   - High-rise buildings (Marriott, Renaissance) confirmed via CTBUH with steel/concrete dominance.  
   - Retail structures show steel-frame consistency (OSM+FEMA).  
3. **Hazard Exposure**:  
   - Seattle properties in USGS Seismic Zone 3/4.  
   - SF locations in FEMA Zone X (minimal flood risk).  
4. **Discrepancies**: Westfield Mall's permit history suggests potential 1986 build (SF Socrata permits).
