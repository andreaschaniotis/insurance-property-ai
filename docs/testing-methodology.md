# Testing Methodology

## Overview
The Insurance Property Location Risk Classification System v7.7 underwent comprehensive testing across 14 different Large Language Models using a carefully designed validation dataset.

## Test Dataset Design

### 50-Location Validation Set
The test dataset was specifically designed to challenge different aspects of the classification system:

- **H-E-B**: City typo + minimal data

## Testing Protocol

### Model Selection
14 LLMs tested representing different:
- **Model families**: GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, QWEN
- **Size categories**: From lightweight (Mini) to largest available
- **Access methods**: Direct API, web interfaces, specialized platforms
- **Cost tiers**: Free, standard, premium pricing models

### Pre-Testing Protocol

#### Memory State Management
Before each model test, a standardized memory cleaning protocol was applied:

1. **Memory Audit**: Custom prompt v2.6 used to assess context state
2. **Context Clearing**: Complete conversation history cleared using specialized memory management commands
3. **Fresh Session**: New session initiated for each model test
4. **Baseline Confirmation**: Verified clean starting state before v7.7 prompt injection

This ensures:
- **No cross-contamination** between model tests
- **Consistent starting conditions** across all 14 LLMs
- **Elimination of context bias** from previous interactions
- **Reproducible testing environment**

#### Memory Cleaning Prompt
A specialized memory management prompt (v2.6) was developed to:
- Audit current context and token usage
- Identify redundant or outdated information  
- Compress or clean memory state as needed
- Provide structured summaries when required
- Execute "CLEAN" commands to reset context before testing

### Standardized Testing Process
1. **Memory Reset**: Applied memory cleaning protocol before each model
2. **Consistent Prompt**: Identical v7.7 prompt across all models
3. **Batch Processing**: Same 50-location dataset for each model
4. **Silent Execution**: No additional prompting or clarification
5. **Raw Output Capture**: Complete unedited responses recorded
6. **Multiple Validation**: Key tests repeated to verify consistency

### Scoring Methodology

### Ground Truth Validation

All test validation points manually verified through:
- **Multiple independent sources**
- **On-site verification** where possible
- **Official business registries**
- **Government databases**
- **Authoritative mapping services**

- **Wegmans ZIP**: Confirmed correct ZIP is 14445

## Quality Assurance

### Human Review Process
- **Double-checking**: All model outputs reviewed by domain expert
- **Bias Detection**: Systematic review for geographic or business type bias
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Special attention to unusual or borderline cases
- **Consistency Verification**: Cross-model comparison for validation

### Limitations Acknowledged
- **Geographic Bias**: Testing focused on English-speaking markets
- **Temporal Factors**: Business status may change between testing and use
- **Model Updates**: LLM performance may vary with version changes
- **Access Variations**: Some models accessed through different interfaces

### Future Testing Plans
- **Expanded Geographic Coverage**: More developing market properties
- **Industry Specialization**: Sector-specific property challenges  
- **Multilingual Testing**: Non-English address handling
- **Integration Testing**: Performance with premium data APIs
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Performance tracking over time
