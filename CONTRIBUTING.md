## Testing Guidelines

### Regional Validation
When testing in new regions:

1. **Create a small test set** (10-20 properties)
2. **Include diverse property types** (retail, industrial, residential)
3. **Mix input formats** (complete data, minimal data, coordinates-only)
4. **Validate results** against local knowledge
5. **Document data source availability** in your region

### Model Comparison
When testing different LLMs:

1. **Use identical inputs** across all models
2. **Test multiple times** to check consistency  
3. **Document any prompt modifications** needed
4. **Compare accuracy and confidence levels**
5. **Note performance differences** by category

### Performance Benchmarking
For systematic testing:

1. **Use the standard 50-location dataset** for comparison
2. **Follow the documented methodology**
3. **Score using the 30-point validation system**
4. **Document any deviations** from standard process
5. **Share both successes and failures**
